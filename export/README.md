Hi im bad at writing readmes
This is a port of the first part of Emerald Coast from Sonic Adventure 1


	3.1.0 This was going to be part of 4.0.0, but it might take a while more, so heres the new stuff:
		- Checkpoints now work
		- Dash Pannels now work, might need some tweaking
		- Rings will give you 5 bucks and take longer to respawn!
		- Slightly better collisions
		- Secret from main game now works in this map too
		- Better map boundaries
		- Changed some SFX, still working on them tho
		- BlueberryWolfi's APIs is now a dependency, please make sure to have it!
